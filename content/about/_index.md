## The Short Version

I am a **Computational Biologist** with a Ph.D. in Human Statistical Genetics and industry experience in immuno-oncology. My work focuses on constructing scalable bioinformatics pipelines and integrating complex multi-omics data to uncover therapeutic targets in cancer.

Currently, I am seeking **Senior Scientist** roles in the **NJ/PA** area, where I can apply my expertise in single-cell genomics and cloud computing to precision medicine challenges.

## My Philosophy: From Raw Reads to Biological Truth

In computational biology, running the tool is the easy part. The real challenge—and where I find my passion—lies in distinguishing biological signal from technical noise.

Throughout my time at **Intellia Therapeutics** and **Washington University**, I have developed a problem-solving framework based on three pillars:

### 1. Reproducibility is Non-Negotiable

I don't just write scripts for today; I build workflows for the future. Whether it is containerizing a pipeline with **Docker** or managing workflows with **Nextflow**, I ensure that my analyses are robust, version-controlled, and reproducible by anyone on the team, independent of the computing environment.

### 2. Context is King

Data without biological context is just numbers. My background in **Human Statistical Genetics** allows me to look at data through a rigorous statistical lens, but my focus is always on the biological outcome. I specialize in integrating disparate data modalities—like **scRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomics**—to reconstruct the tumor microenvironment in high definition.

### 3. Scalability by Design

Biology is getting bigger. I architect solutions that scale from a single sample to thousands. My experience building cloud-based pipelines on **AWS** and **Google Cloud** ensures that computational bottlenecks never slow down biological discovery.

## Technical Expertise

My toolkit is built to solve problems across the entire data lifecycle:

-**Data Analysis & Statistics:** R (Bioconductor), Python (Pandas/Scikit-learn), MATLAB.
    
- **Pipeline Engineering:** Nextflow, Snakemake, Docker, Git.
    
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS (EC2/S3/Batch), Google Cloud Platform.
    
- **Genomics Focus:** Single-cell transcriptomics, Spatial transcriptomics, Somatic/Germline variant calling (CNV/SNV).
    

## My Journey

### Industry Impact

Most recently, as a **Computational Scientist at Intellia Therapeutics**, I engineered scalable pipelines for bulk and single-cell RNA-seq. I spearheaded multi-omics analyses that provided critical insights into the tumor microenvironment, directly supporting cross-functional teams in making data-driven decisions.

### Academic Roots

My foundation was built at **Washington University in St. Louis**, where I completed my Ph.D. My doctoral work focused on:

- Pioneering multimodal data analysis of **clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC)**.
    
- Constructing somatic CNV pipelines for large-scale cancer genomics.
    
- Validating rare germline CNVs using cloud-based architectures.
    

This work contributed to publications in _Nature Communications_, _Cancer Cell_, and _Cell_, as well as a U.S. Patent application for novel cancer treatment methods.

## Let's Connect

I am always interested in discussing new challenges in **biomarker discovery**, **CRISPR/Cas9 therapy support**, and **multi-omics integration**.
