Summary
-------

I am a computational biologist with a PhD in Human Statistical Genetics (Washington University in St. Louis) and industry experience at Intellia Therapeutics. My work focuses on multi-omics integration, biomarker discovery, and scalable bioinformatics pipelines to support precision medicine and immune-oncology research.

Core competencies
-----------------
- Programming: R, Python, Shell, Linux, MATLAB, C++, Conda, parallel computing
- Bioinformatics: NGS (exome/genome), somatic/germline variant calling, CNV detection, scRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics/metabolomics
- Data analysis: Statistical modeling, machine learning, multimodal integration, visualization
- Pipelines & DevOps: Reproducible workflows, cloud (AWS/GCP), Docker, Git
- Leadership: Project management, mentoring, cross-functional collaboration
- Communication: Scientific writing, presentations, technical documentation

Experience highlights
---------------------
- Computational Scientist, Intellia Therapeutics (01/2023 – 01/2025): engineered scalable pipelines for single-cell and bulk RNA-seq; led multi-omics analyses to inform research goals.
- Postdoctoral Research Associate & PhD, Washington University in St. Louis (2016–2023): developed CNV and proteogenomics pipelines; contributed to large-scale multi-institution studies and high-impact publications.
